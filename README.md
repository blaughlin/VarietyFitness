# OVERVIEW
This is a database project for cs340 by Bernard Lauglin and Raul Preciado.
We created a simple Database for a gym that  keeps track of members, employees, classes, class members and invoices. Our website supports CRUD functionality for all entities.
The code is based on the OSU Ecampus Flask Starter App available at: https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/flask-starter-app/blob/master/README.md
We referred to the flask starter guide constantly throughout the spring 2024 term. The most recent date being 6/10/2024
We followed steps 0 - step 7. The logic in filling in each template page using jinja scripts derives from step 4.
